# Web Application

Web Application rendering of the application, as an SPA. Because the application
uses the Lustre devtools, nothing is needed here to make it work. Launch the
server, heads up to [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) and let the magic
happen.

## Getting started

```sh
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```
